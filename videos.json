The visuals and sounds were created with AI and edited by me.\n\nIf you use my video in your edits, please credit my channel.\n\nIn this story, Steve Rogers tries to live a quiet life with Peggy Carter, away from the battles of the past. But his peace shatters when a familiar face appears; Tony Stark, who had fallen in the war against Thanos. Steve Rogers struggles to believe what he sees, and his doubts prove true. A strange symbol tattoo on \u201cTony\u2019s\u201d wrist reveals the truth: this is not Tony\u2026 This is Doctor Doom.\n\nDistrust grows between the two, and Doom quickly subdues Steve Rogers. Yet Doom makes one mistake, underestimating Peggy Carter. Distracting and wounding him, Peggy gives Steve Rogers the chance to break free from Doom\u2019s spell. With one final strike, Steve Rogers turns the tide, but the wounded Doom escapes through his portal. Their confrontation is far from over\u2026 and the clash between Steve Rogers and Doctor Doom is only beginning.\n\n#AvengersDoomsday #DoctorDoom #CaptainAmerica #Marvel",
